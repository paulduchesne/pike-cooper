# Pike-Cooper

Data sourced from Andrew Pike and Ross Cooper's excellent overview of the early Australian film industry, [Australian Film 1900-1977](https://www.roninfilms.com.au/video/2221/0/2245.html).

Federating with NFSA and ACMI holdings via Wikidata identifiers should provide an overview of extant components for these films. 

Here is an example using the open [ACMI API](https://github.com/ACMILabs/acmi-api).
